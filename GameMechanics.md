## Tips & Strategies

### For New Players
1. **Stick Together**: Easier to handle combat
2. **Communicate**: Use emotes liberally
3. **Experiment**: Try different echo combinations
4. **Watch AP**: Don't waste action points
5. **Learn Enemy Patterns**: Each type has tells

### For Coordinated Groups
1. **Role Distribution**: Balance tanks, DPS, support
2. **Split Farming**: Cover more ground efficiently
3. **Echo Planning**: Coordinate complementary builds
4. **Resource Management**: Share items strategically
5. **Boss Strategies**: Assign positions and roles

### For Speedrunners
1. **Movement Tech**: Animation canceling saves time
2. **Optimal Paths**: Some floors have shortcuts
3. **Echo Routes**: Plan build from start

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
