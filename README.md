# üåå Umbral Nexus

> **Link your raid. Cast your screen. Reconnect a shattered reality.**

Umbral Nexus is a cooperative, turn-based roguelike dungeon crawler designed for large groups (1-20 players). Using smartphones as controllers and a shared screen for viewing, it creates a unique "party raid" experience that's perfect for social gatherings, streaming events, and team-building activities.
